abstract: The Dominican Republic has experienced contingencies throughout its economic history, from democratic regimes to authoritarian leadership, U.S. military interventions to freedom, monopolies to free competition, recessions and strong economic growth. Half an island in the Caribbean is thriving to become a key player on international trade and commerce among all major islands in Latin America.  The paper describes historical context on how the Dominican Republic appealed to new ways of building infrastructure for its impoverished society at cost of corruption and loss of financial sovereignty.  The paper also includes the Latin America Debt crisis and how the International Monetary Fund provided solutions to keep inflation under control. Another major meltdown during the 2000â€™s occurred due to corruption, tax regulation, and bank failures.
